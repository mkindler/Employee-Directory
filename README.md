## Description

The Employee Directory is an application built using React -- specifically `Create React App` -- that allows users to view, filter, and sort a directory of employees. A user can view a headshot, the name, email address, phone number, and date of birth of each employee. If a user needs to organize or narrow their results, they can sort the various fields in ascending or descending order. A user can also search for employees by name.
